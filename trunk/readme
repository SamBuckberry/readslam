*** OVERVIEW ****
	ReadSlam is a pipeline for handling bisulfite-converted reads that have 
	been sequenced by a Solexa Genome Analyzer. ReadSlam is designed to run on 
	64-bit Linux systems. Pipeline components include:

	- parse      : convert from a different format into .slam format
	- prefilter  : drop bad reads and trim adapters from the 3' end of reads 
	- map        : align reads to a reference genome
	- collapse   : drop clonal reads (the best is kept)
	- stack      : generate coverage stacks for the reference genome
	- postfilter : drop reads that failed bisulfite conversion & trim 3' ends
	- call       : make base calls based on stacks
	
	Several other tools are included for performing various file manipulation 	
	functions. A PHP controller script may also have been included with this
	distribution.

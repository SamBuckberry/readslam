	Sample configuration file for running the entire pipeline in one go.
	In here, you provide information about the source data (a single file
	of reads from the sequencer), a working directory, and then choose
	which components of the pipeline should be active and how they should
	run. This file is used by the /bin/slam binary.
	
	Usage:
	/path/to/readslam/bin/slam /path/to/config.json

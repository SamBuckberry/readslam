:: ReadSlam ::

ReadSlam is a pipeline for handling data from Solexa deep sequencing.

- parsing    : convert from a different format into .slam format
- prefilter  : drop bad reads and trim adapters from the 3' end of reads
- map        : align reads to a reference genome
- collapse   : drop clonal reads (the best is kept)
- stack      : generate coverage stacks for the reference genome
- postfilter : drop reads that failed bisulfite conversion & trim 3' ends
- call       : make base calls based on stacks

:: Installation :: 

ReadSlam is designed only for 64-bit Linux systems

Just type 'make' and the binaries will be in the readslam/bin directory.
